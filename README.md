# Krypt - Crypto Portfolio Application

Krypt is a comprehensive crypto portfolio management application that allows users to monitor, manage, and transfer their cryptocurrency holdings seamlessly. With a user-friendly interface, Krypt enables users to connect their wallet, transfer tokens, create a customized watchlist, and view the different token allowances they have granted through various smart contracts.

**Note**: Since this is a test app, it will only retrieve transaction information from the Sepolia Testnet network. However, it can be easily configured for the Ethereum mainnet.
